**PRESO DAL VECCHIO SITO, URGE NUOVA PRESENTAZIONE GENERICA DEL FESTIVAL**

The Conservatory of Rome presents the 1st Edition of the “International Electroacoustic Music Festival of the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia”. 
The Festival will take place from the 18th to the 30th of November, 2008.

Only sixty years after its introduction, Electronic and Electroacoustic Music has already won  wide circulation.  A large majority of music that we listen to is now produced, at least partly, with electronic means, through which many of the sounds of our time are developed. Nowadays much of what we have come to think of as 'art related music' is electroacoustic music:  it is created in private and public  production and research centres throughout the world; it is also common, however, that individual composers use their own personal equipment. The field of electroacoustic music is properly at the attention of applied research. The study of new methods of analysis, synthesis and elaboration of sound is extremely important not only for art related music, but also for industries involved in electronic musical instruments and professional audio.  Universities in many different countries work in this field of research, others are dealing with the questions relative to the perception of organized sound, investigating the cognitive aspects of the enjoyment of music. Original methodologies have developed within the sphere of musicology for the analysis of this kind of music as well, and this has led to remarkable contributions to considerations being made on music itself.

Electroacoustic music, therefore, represents an interdisciplinary field, the meeting place of art, science and technology.  Different kinds of expertise meet, where the specificity of each  must be overcome and the gaze must be raised higher than one’s own province in order to build together a knowledge, creation and expression.

The Course of Electronic Music at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory of Rome was one of the first in Italy.  The first teacher was Franco Evangelisti, one of the foremost representatives of the Italian and European  experimental avant-garde.  Thanks to him, its first professor, the School of Electronic Music of Rome has been known since then for the quality and depth of the specialization in composition.

The Conservatory of Rome with this first edition of the “International Electroacoustic Music Festival of the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia”. wishes to create a milestone appointment in Italy, one which will facilitate the understanding of the global production in the field of electroacoustic music. An appointment in October 2008 in the historic center of Rome: to listen to today's music; reflect on this music, its techniques, instruments and expressive mediums.
During the nine days of the Festival, conferences, concerts and special events will be held in varying locations.  The special events will be the performance of various historically important electroacoustic pieces.  The concerts will be  given by students and teachers from the Conservatory.  Students will have the chance to establish direct and live contact with contemporary electroacoustic music by being able to speak directly to the composers, confronting problematic technical and expressive aspects of the various programmed works.

These pieces will be selected after an announcement of the competition has been published on the internet, the purpose of which is to attract a broad response, giving everyone the opportunity to participate.

The festival will aim to provide a representative sample of international electroacoustic music; the selection will be made on this basis, taking into account practical and technical feasibility of the pieces.
All compositions entered, regardless of whether selected for the 1st Edition of the Festival or not, will remain part of  Santa Cecilia's library collection.

The Festival will last nine days, from 18 to 30 November. It will be divided in two cycles: EMUFEST at “Tor Vergata” and EMUFEST at the “center” of Rome. The first two days (November 18, 20) of the Festival will take place at “Tor Vergata” University of Rome, one day at the IILA (November 27) and the last six days (November 24-26 and 28-30) at the S.Cecilia Conservatory of Music. The audiovisual works  will be presented at the “Sala dei Medaglioni” at the S.Cecilia Conservatory in three afternoon concerts. Installations will be set-up at the S.Cecilia Conservatory of Music. Individual listening points will be set-up to let the audience appreciate and listen to all the works submitted.
