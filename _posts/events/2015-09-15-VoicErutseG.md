## Integra Lab

[Integra Lab](http://integra.io/lab) is an interdisciplinary research lab, with
a focus on musician-computer interaction. Our goal is to create new technologies
that empower, inspire and delight musicians. Integra Lab provides a unique
opportunity for researchers in interactive music technology, user-centred
design and digital signal processing to enhance musical experience through
direct collaboration with performers and composers.   

Integra Lab was founded in 2009 to support the 3.1Me EU-funded Integra project.
Bringing together new music ensembles, research centres and higher music
education institutions from eight European countries and Canada, Integra
promoted the wider dissemination of live electronic music and provided
composers, performers, teachers and students with the tools to interact with
technology in a more user-friendly and musically meaningful way.

## Balandino Di Donato

[Balandino](http://www.balandinodidonato.com) is a full-time Ph.D. candidate at
the Integra Lab - Birmingham Conservatoire. His research is focused on live
sound spatialisation using live gestural control.

He started his musical studies at A. Casella Conservatoire of L'Aquila (Italy)
in 2007. In the meantime, he was collaborating at the CRM - Centro Ricerche
Musicali di Roma as artistic, informatics and technical assistant.
In 2013, he completed his undergraduate studies with a thesis regarding the
development ad use of applications for the Tangible User Interface Metis.
After his studies, he experienced an internship for seven months at the
Integra Lab for the development of Integra Live, where later on he gained a
position as Ph.D. Student.
Over the period 2014-2015, he attended actively IRCAM forum net (France),
Frontiers Festival (UK), Moog Sound Lab Residency (UK), electroAQustica (Italy)
and Music Tech Fest (Sweden), where he has been selected for the Music Bricks
project (part of the EU project Horizon 2020). Afterwards, Balandino has been
selected for the ICAD15 Student ThinkThank (Austria), where he published a
paper concerning the use of the Myo armband1 within live electronics and
Mixed Reality contexts.

One of his latest works is ’equinode’, an interactive sound art installation
exhibited at Vagiti Ultimi 2015.

## Pre-Concert Talk

The pre-concert talk will go through an overview of the Integra Lab’s activities.
More in detail, it will be discussed Balandino’s work and what is behind VoicErutseG.
Baladino’s ongoing research concerns the study of body movements played during
a vocal music performance and their relationship with the musical result.
Out-coming understandings from such study, drive the development of the gSPAT.
It is an interactive system able to track and map singers’ movements into
spatialisation parameters.

## VoicErutseG

[VoicErutseG](http://www.balandinodidonato.com/publications-and-works/voicerutseg-v0-1/)
is an interactive performance, which shows the early results of the research
conducted by Balandino Di Donato at the Integra Lab.
In VoicErutseG the voice of the Soprano Vittoriana De Amicis is spatialised
using the gSPAT, while she will be performing Sequenza III by Luciano Berio
and Stryspody by Cathy Berberian.

## Integra Live hands-on

[Integra Live](http://www.integralive.org) features will be exposed through
live demo. Composers, researchers and practitioners are invited to come along
with their laptops, Integra Live projects, musical instruments, questions
and ideas to realise over the hands-on.

## Integra Live

Integra Live is an application that makes it easy to use interactive audio
processing to create new music. The software was originally supported through
the EU funded Integra Project, and is now developed by Integra Lab at
Birmingham Conservatoire. The software has applications in education as well as
professional artistic practice and opens up new possibilities for those
seeking an entry point into interactive live electronics.
Integra Live has been built from the ground up using open source software and
open standards. Our audio processing host runs in the Pure Data engine,
communicating with the Integra server via Open Sound Control messaging.
The graphical front end is written using the open source Apache Flex framework.
Integra Live itself is freely available under the GNU GPL license with source
code available on Sourceforge.
