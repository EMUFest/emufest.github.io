A project by **MIUR Alta formazione artistica** and
**Ambasciata degli Stati Uniti in Italia** made by
**Centro Ricerche Musicali - CRM**, Rome

in collaboration with:

- Conservatorio di Musica *Santa Cecilia*, Rome
- Conservatorio di Musica *Alfredo Casella*, L’Aquila
- Conservatorio di Musica *Luigi Canepa*, Sassari
- Conservatorio di Musica *Francesco Morlacchi*, Perugia
- Conservatorio di Musica *Giuseppe Martucci*, Salerno

Curtis Roads is one of the most important figure in experimental music and international protagonist of computer music. [*Point Line Cloud*](http://asphodel.com/releases/view.php?Id=11), the Curtis Roads musical project, inspired the project promoted by the five institutes of higher artistic education to promote specialized masterclasses for students, composers and music players.

<!-- Compositore, autore di testi scientifici, programmatore, didatta, creatore di software per applicazioni musicali quali PulsarGenerator e Creatovox, è stato il primo ad implementare tecniche di sintesi ed elaborazione del suono basate sulla Sintesi granulare. -->

<!-- Il progetto, sostenuto dall’*Ambasciata degli Stati Uniti in Italia* e dal *MIUR Alta formazione artistica*, consolida la collaborazione già avviata con quattro di queste Istituzioni con le quali il *Centro Ricerche Musicali* ha stipulato una Convenzione per le attività di ricerca e formazione.   -->

<!-- Il Centro Ricerche Musicali intende presentare le più avanzate esperienze formative e performative volte alla promozione, alla creazione, alla diffusione della musica contemporanea in un progetto strutturato di incontri, masterclass, laboratori e produzioni di forme di fruizione innovative.
Lo studio associato all’azione e all’attività artistica diventano un ambito esperienziale che i giovani musicisti possono intraprendere con la consapevolezza di potersi avvalere di competenze professionali elevate di artisti e ricercatori di fama internazionale. -->

<!-- Il programma proposto da Curtis Roads è coordinato dal CRM in collaborazione con i docenti e coordinatori dei Dipartimenti di Musica e nuove tecnologie dei Conservatori coinvolti.

Oltre alla presentazione di master class, a Roma e a Sassari verranno presentati due concerti di opere del compositore. -->

#### CURTIS ROADS

Curtis Roads teaches and pursues research in the interdisciplinary territory spanning music and technology. He was Editor and Associate Editor of Computer Music Journal (The MIT Press) from 1978 to 2000, and cofounded the International Computer Music Association in 1979. A researcher in computer music at MIT (1980-1986), he also worked in the computer industry for a decade. He taught electronic music composition at Harvard University, and sound synthesis techniques at the University of Naples. He was appointed Director of Pedagogy at the Centre de Création de Musique Iannis Xenakis (CCMIX) and Lecturer in the Music Department of the Université Paris 8.
Among his books are the anthologies Foundations of Computer Music (1985, The MIT Press) and The Music Machine (1989, The MIT Press). His textbook The Computer Music Tutorial (1996, The MIT Press) is widely adopted as a standard classroom text and has been published in French (1999, second edition 2007), Japanese (2001), and Chinese (2012) editions. He edited the anthology Musical Signal Processing in 1997. His book, Microsound (2001, The MIT Press) presents the techniques and aesthetics of composition with sound particles.
A pioneer in the development of granular synthesis (1974), he also developed (with Alberto de Campo) a sound particle synthesis program PulsarGenerator (2001), distributed by the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE) at UCSB.
His collection of electronic music compositions POINT LINE CLOUD won the Award of Distinction at the 2002 Ars Electronica in Linz and was released as a CD + DVD on the Asphodel label in 2005.
His latest book is Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic (2015) published by Oxford University Press. A new revised edition of The Computer Music Tutorial by The MIT Press is in progress.
He is keenly interested in the integration of electronic music with visual and spatial media.
Since 2004, he has been researching a new method of sound analysis that is the analytical counterpart of granular synthesis called dictionary-based pursuit, which has been sponsored by the National Science Foundation. A new collection of electronic music is in the works.

Dr. Curtis Roads is Professor of Media Arts and Technology and also Associate Director of the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE) at UCSB.

He studied music composition and computer programming at California Institute of the Arts, the University of California, San Diego (BA Summa Cum Laude), and the Université Paris 8 (Doctorate «Très honorable avec félicitations du jury»). From 1980 to 1986 he was a researcher in computer music at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the MIT Media Laboratory. He then taught at the University of Naples Federico II, Harvard University, Oberlin Conservatory, CCMIX (Paris), and the Université Paris 8.

He has led masterclasses at the Australian National Conservatory (Melbourne) and the Prometeo Laboratorio (Parma), among others. He is co-organizer of international workshops on musical signal processing in Sorrento, Capri, and Santa Barbara (1988, 1991, 1997, 2000). He has served on the composition juries of the Ars Electronica (Linz) and the International Electroacoustic Music Competition (Bourges, France).

A cofounder of the International Computer Music Association in 1979, he was Editor of Computer Music Journal (The MIT Press) from 1978 to 1989, and Associate Editor 1990-2000.

His research is focused on microsound synthesis (granular, pulsar, and related techniques), pluriphonic spatialization, notation and visualization of sound, and the history and aesthetics of electronic music composition. His research on dictionary-based pursuit of analyzing audio signals (with Bob Sturm, Aaron Mcleran, and John Shynk) was supported by a National Science Foundation grant (2007-2009).

In 2001, Roads and Alberto de Campo developed PulsarGenerator, a widely distributed application for sound particle synthesis. Together with David Thall, he developed EmissionControl (2005, updated 2008), a program for generalized granular synthesis.

His composition Clang-Tint (1994) was commissioned by the Japan Ministry of Culture (Bunka-cho) and the Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo. His music is available on recordings produced by Asphodel, MODE, OR, the MIT Media Laboratory, and Wergo.
In 2002 he won the Ars Electronica Award of Distinction for POINT LINE CLOUD, a collection of electronic music with videos by Brian O'Reilly. POINT LINE CLOUD was released on the Asphodel (San Francisco) label in 2005 and he has performed it in venues such as the Paris Planetarium, Instanbul Technical University, Venice Conservatory, Paradiso (Amsterdam), All Tomorrow’s Parties UK (Camber Sands), El Rey Theater (Los Angeles), Recombinant Media Lab (San Francisco), Eastman School of Music (Rochester), Teatro Farnese (Parma), and the Sonic Arts Research Centre (Belfast).

Pieces from his new set of music (forthcoming) were premiered at the Festival Tage Neue Musik, Zürich, Switzerland in November 2009 and at the CREATE concert at UCSB in 2010.

His books include Foundations of Computer Music (1985, The MIT Press), Composers and the Computer (1985, AR Editions), The Music Machine (1989, The MIT Press), Representations of Musical Signals (1991, The MIT Press), Musical Signal Processing (co-editor, 1997, Swets and Zeitlinger, Amsterdam), and Microsound (2001, The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts).

His book, The Computer Music Tutorial (1996, The MIT Press) is the best-selling textbook in the field, and has been published in French as L'audionumérique (1998, new edition 2007, Éditions Dunod, Paris) and Japanese (2001, Denki Daigaku Shuppan, Tokyo). A Chinese edition is forthcoming.

His current book project is Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic (Forthcoming, Oxford University Press).

A revised edition of The Computer Music Tutorial (The MIT Press) is also in the works.
