## Thomas Müntzer

*Thomas Müntzer* (ca. 1488, Stolberg, Saxony-Anhalt – 27 May 1525) was an early Reformation-era German theologian, who became a rebel leader during the Peasants' War. He turned against Luther with several anti-Lutheran writings, and supported the Anabaptists. In the battle at Frankenhausen, Müntzer and his farmers were defeated. He was captured, tortured and decapitated.
