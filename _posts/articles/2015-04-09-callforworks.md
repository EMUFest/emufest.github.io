The Rome Conservatoire presents the 8th edition of EMUFest (International Festival of Electroacoustic Music of Rome)

**The festival will take place from 21st to 26th September 2015.**

Works will have to fall in one of the following three categories or combinations:
 
 1. **Acousmatic works**:   
    compositions for recorded-only sounds (synthesised or/and concrete), from one to eight channels.
 2. **Audiovisual compositions**:   
    recorded audiovisual works where video and audio have the same artistic relevance.
 3. **Live performances with electronics**:   
    works with acoustic instruments and live electronics and/or recorded audio, performances of live electronics only. 
	
**Each author can submit a maximum of one works.**

All works submitted for the 8th edition of the Festival, be they selected or not, will be held permanently in the S. Cecilia Conservatoire Library, unless judged completely non-relevant.

Submission and registration to EMUFest is done by filling the **submission form** with all the required information and sending all necessary materials to the festival committee.

Once the form has been filled, the author will receive a personal code via email, the code will have to be marked on the envelope containing the submitted work. Such code will uniquely identify each work.

**The registration form will be more not available after 23:59 am CEST on May 31st, 2015.** The materials must be sent to the Festival office by the closing date of the announcement (date of postmark).

**The selected works will be announced by June 15th, 2015.**

Choices will be made exclusively on the basis of representativeness of the international situation of electroacoustic music and feasibility of the program of the Festival.
