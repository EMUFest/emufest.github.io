## Per volontà e per caso

The artist and theoretician Pierre Boulez has deeply marked the European culture and his recent passing away further highlights the leading role of his work.

The sentence *Par volonté et par hasard* (*Per volontà e per caso* in italian), taken from an interview by Boulez to the Belgian musicologist Célestin Deliège in the seventies, condenses and integrates the attitude for experimentation and research that characterizes modern music from the last century til today.

Honoring Boulez, EMUfest 2016 intends to pursue a project that is ethical as well as educational.  It is dedicated to the values of musical research, that is innovation, freedom of expression and consciousness, and a constant attention to the relation between art and its social environment.
The Festival considers these values to be fundamental and strives to promote them through every form of expression that interprets and stimulates contemporary thought through music.

EMUfest is characterized this year by three types of activities: the ***Sequence***, the ***Events*** and the ***Fusions***.

The ***Sequence*** is the result of the selection and interpretation of the new musical works. It is composed by 11 concerts and performances in which  20th century music alternates with the latest international works of young composers.

The ***Events*** are realized in collaboration with other Italian Conservatories, Festivals or other Institutions. They consist of conferences, seminars and concerts of internationally known musicians and researchers during the Summer - Autumn 2016 period.

The ***Fusions***, produced with the collaboration of international teachers and performers, introduce the approach to contemporary composition and performance of music in tutorial and performative form.
